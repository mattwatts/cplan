C-Plan is a conservation decision support software that links with GIS to map options for achieving explicit conservation targets. It was developed by Matt Watts and Bob Pressey. It acts as a graphical user interface for Marxan and can generate Marxan datasets from C-Plan datasets. It interfaces with either ESRI ArcView 3 GIS or Zonae Cogito to act as the GIS GUI. It is compatible with Windows (tested up to Windows 7 by the authors).

# Instructions on installing C-Plan (version 4)

 The installation of C-Plan is simplified over older versions.  Just run the C-Plan install set, then follow the instructions for installing Zonae Cogito. There is a link to the Zonae Cogito download on the C-Plan 4 download page.
 
# Instructions on installing C-Plan (version 3.4)

 First, install the BDE (Borland Database Engine). Then install C-Plan. 

C-Plan needs ArcView3.X GIS for the map module to work. It will work without the ArcView GIS present, but there is no map display. 

If you are using ArcView, you may need to install cplan.avx into "C:\ESRI\AV_GIS30\ARCVIEW\EXT32\", the default install path for ArcView extensions.
